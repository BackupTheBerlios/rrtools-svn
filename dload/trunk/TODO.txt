DLoad Todo:
-----------

* Streaming demo: load scrolltext from file... or gfx? hmmm...

* t1581 needs a short delay between loads, or it hangs. why?!?


MMC ToDo:
---------

* detect MMC64 hardware in installer

* Shutup/Wakeup emulation (bankbits in $dd00/$dd02)


Done:
-----

* imagebrowser for mmc

Shutup works and implemented into stresstest
* shutup/wakeup did not work with new transfer routines,
  add this function to the stresstest (and all other missing ones) to get a test for the complete loader
